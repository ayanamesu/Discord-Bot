# Discord API has a limited number of requests (bot requests) per day.
# If developers meet that quota, then Discord will put a temporal ban to your bot (24 hours)
# In order to avoid that, and only for testing, create unit test methods to test your functions
# without using the functionality provided by your bot. Once all your tests passed, then you can
# integrate these functions with your bot logic in main.py

# staff_shift = Update_staff_shifts('THURS-FRI' , 'staff_id'))
# print(staff_shift)

#print(get_descending_order()))

#res = insert.terminal(1, term, main, 1, 3, 2, 3, 20USD)
#print(res)

# staff = staff.all()
# for staffs in staff:
#     print(staff.name + ' ' + staff.last_name)
